 When you rust, each time you borrow, you run a wire, from the place where you borrow, to the place where you last use the borrow. The longer the wire, the weaker it is, it hangs lower and lower. The lower the wire hangs, the more borrow checker will try to break it. Especially in places where there is more than one such wire. To protect yourself from this behaviour, you either run short strong cables, isolate cables with Rc and Arc, or use wireless connection, by storing (for example) an index into a vector, or using just a field of a struct every time instead of borrowing it.
