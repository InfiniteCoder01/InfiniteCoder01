(Explained for MTK devices. I've heard, that qualcomm is simpler, but should be similar) Phone starts from bootrom (brom) (you can flash stuff in here), then it loads preloader (which is for some reason flashable, preloaer.img/preloader.bin) (you can also flash stuff in here?), then, after 2-4 seconds, it loads and displays logo, which contains company's boot logo (Xiaomi, Huawei, Google Pixel, Vivo, etc.) (logo.img/logo.bin, if it's messed up, you are stuck in preloader). At this point, you have a choice: hold Vol+ button (usually, might be another button/combination) to get into recovery (recovery.img), which has a capability to flash stuff (not all stock recoveries can flash stuff). It can flash ONLY if the bootloader is unlocked. Vol- button (usually) puts you into fastboot mode, which is made to flash stuff and mess with parititions (again, can ONLY flash/read if bootloader is unlocked). No buttons held make boot process continue - boot (boot.img) gets loaded, which is the kernel. It loads system space (system.img) and user space (userdata.img) and it is your android. Some devices (I guess Android 7+, which is where Verified Boot 2 appeared) also have vbmeta for verified boot data, which is here to mess up your day, when you are flashing something unofficial. Some devices (my case) have little kernel (lk(2).img/lk(2).bin), which is loaded before boot to load the main kernel. Thre are also tee (trusted something, used in android internally). md1arm7, md1dsp md1img, md3img are modem metadata. scp which is something secure. And there is cust.img, which is the only protected by verified boot for me (bootloader locked), which holds location and localization data. There is also cache (cache.img, idk what is in here)
