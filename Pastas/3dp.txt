It's an old Anet A8 I got for free during the competitions. At this point I was actually trying to make my own printer, because back then ready printers were too expensive for me. After 3 years of printing, I have gotten sick of Anet A8 and I do really want to upgrade it. Now, I have remade the hotend like 4 times (original -> hinge mod -> bowden -> stealthburner -> simplest possible BMG direct drive, couldn't test because I burned it in the process) and I've burned and replaced the original motherboard by RAMPS 1.5 (which I guess I burned, possibly with the original power supply, which is the worst case, because power supplies are EXPENSIVE). I also installed klipper on my old RPi 3B, which was a nice upgrade, except that I reinstalled it 4 times because I wanted to try new solutions (OctoPrint (I know, it's not really klipper) -> mainsail -> fluidd -> RatOS). Now I want to make a custom control board (because for whatever reason there are next to none sold here in Belarus, and the ones that are cost like 3 power supplies, exclinding the poor RAMPS) and use TMC2225 stepper drivers (as opposed to cheap A4988, TMC can read the motor current, are much quieter, more powerful, heat up less and have sensorless homing. But for more control and sensorless homing I need to connect them via UART, which is not supported by RAMPS 1.5, so I'm making my own). After that, as you can see by the TODO plan, I also want to upgrade the kinematics, because I'm sick of the acrylic sheets. Possibly doing a CoreXY with a wide, 9mm belt, or just Anet AM8 (metal version)
